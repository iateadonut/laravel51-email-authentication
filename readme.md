## Laravel5.1 email authentication

This is an implementation of the work of Luca Bernardino at codeanchor.net,
originally created in laravel 5.0, then upgraded to laravel 5.1 LTS.

There are a few changes, including the refactoring he talks about for
 AuthenticatesAndRegistersUsers.php, in this tutorial:
 http://www.codeanchor.net/blog/email-activation-laravel/ .
 
I've also added a 'resend activation email' option and made use of the Lang
class, so this can easily be ported to a new language.

To get up and running, after git cloning, first do (from the app root):

	composer update

	chmod -R 777 storage

	cp .env.example .env

then make sure to set up your database values in .env:

	DB_DATABASE=homestead
	DB_USERNAME=homestead
	DB_PASSWORD=secret

then run:

	php artisan migrate


Then make sure your variables are set up in .env:

	MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
	MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
	MAIL_PORT=465
	MAIL_USERNAME=user@gmail.com
	MAIL_PASSWORD=password

This should be fine if you've set up a gmail account to run with this.


Then sign up by going to your app.

Don't worry if /home doesn't work before you have a single user.  It will
work after you have at least one.
